# (Computational) Text Analysis 1

This repository includes learning materials for students attending the workshop "(Computational) Text Analysis 1" at the University of Sheffield. The aim of this workshop is to provide a gentle introduction to computational text analysis using the R programming language. To be able to follow the workshop, you will need to have R and RStudio installed on your computer. For a quick guide on how to install the software, you can refer to this [video]([https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/mash/stats-resources/r#]) by MASH (Maths and Statistics Help) at UoS.
